This is my final project for Introduction to Applications Programming. I built a mock database for my former employer, the Boston University Community Service Center.
This application has models for volunteers, service events, and community partners. It allows the user to manage all of those models and their connectivity to organize
volunteer service across the Greater Boston Area.
