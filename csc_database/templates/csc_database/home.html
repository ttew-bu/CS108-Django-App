<h2>How to Use the CSC Database Effectively</h2>
</center>
<div style= "margin: 12px 10%;">
    <li>Within this database, there are 3 models that you can interact with: Volunteers, Community Partners, and Service Events.</li>
    <li>Pages can be navigated using the toolbar above as well as clicking on any partner, event, or volunteer name as those are hyperlinked with the appropriate pages</li>
    <li>Forms will guide you with how to input information if incorrect, but you can always edit every object for every model using that model's update page</li>
    <li>Volunteer and partner impact reports generate automatically as events associated with each are completed;
     if you miss an event, you can always backdate information using the create/update functions</li>
</div>
<center>
<h3>Why does the database exist?</h3>
</center>
<p style= "margin: 12px 10%;">
This database exists so that the Community Service Center can more effectively track all of the models above and track the relative impact of the service.
Some examples of this include seeing past volunteers at a community partner or having volunteer recommendations for a service event.
The database utilzes the concept of "service value" as a different way to track volunteer service beyond the typical benchmark of hours.
It is important to know that the service values in the database right now are arbitrary; 
it should be up to the CSC team to figure out what certain service opportunities are worth.
